Previously, each function intended for use by agents needed to be configured individually on the client side, which added complexity and hindered usability. With MCP, clients can now seamlessly integrate with the MCP server, streamlining the process and enhancing the efficiency of incorporating these functions into their agentic systems."],"metadata":{"id":"i5F0CPgi88TW"}}]}
